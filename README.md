This project was an easy one starting off but gradually became harder as I encountered trying to print my array to my html document with the dom. 
This project was my first time using onject constructers and they proved to be a very valuable item in creating multiple object items when needed. 
My most dificult problem with this project was trying to loop throgh the array of books created and post them to the html page. I was able to figure out
how to post them to the page and then my next problem came about. I was getting duplicates of each book everytime the array would be looped through. So I 
tried multiple solutions and came to the solution that i used that proved most useful in my situation. I first would call the element on the html page and 
then remove that element before looping through the array again and posting the books to the html page. So each time it would delete each html div and then 
post each div with the book from the array again.
